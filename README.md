Restored from the /zip folder in the wyseupOrig backup. Hacking around to make it run on a Dreamhost instance with non-ancient PHP

Clone this into the root directory of a http server instance with PHP running and it should run.

Currently the main page loads, including all images and CSS, and the "Free Demo" button launches the "Game" itself in a new window. The game pulls in data from the database, allowing you to select and begin two different scenarios. At the time of writing, clicking on any of the buttons doesn't do anything, so you can't get past the first screen. Critically the Wyze/Unwyze buttons are broken.	

At present, the app is hosted on gordon, my DreamHost instance, in the /home/dh_spdipt/wyzeup.dreamhosters.com folder.
